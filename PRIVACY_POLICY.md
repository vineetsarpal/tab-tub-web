# Privacy Policy for TabTub

**Last Updated:** July 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how TabTub ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Use
TabTub is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All data processed by TabTub, specifically your saved tab URLs and titles, is:

- **Stored Locally:** Primarily within your browser's local storage.
- **Synchronized via Chrome's Built-in Sync:** For users who are signed into Chrome, your saved tabs are synchronized across your devices using `chrome.storage.sync`. This synchronization is handled entirely by Google's infrastructure, and TabTub does not have direct access to or control over this sync process, or the data on Google's servers.

We do not use cookies, track your browsing history, or collect any analytics data.

## 2. Information Sharing and Disclosure
TabTub does not share, sell, or disclose any of your information with third parties. As no data is collected by us, there is no data to share.

## 3. Data Security
Since TabTub does not transmit user data to external servers, the security of your data relies on the security of your Chrome browser and your Google account (for synced data). We encourage users to maintain
strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for their Google accounts.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 5. Contact Us
